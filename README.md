## Crime and Economics Agent Based Model using Netlogo 
### - This agent-based model was developed for my master's thesis on Crime and Economics, defended in March 2021 at Federal University of Paraná.
### - The version of Netlogo that we worked on was 6.1.1.

The work issue involved building a model capable of predicting the profile of people who are more likely to be robbed or robbed on the streets of Curitiba. This is important when dealing with public security policies because they need to be assertive in the security of everyone, but especially those who need it most. Using probabilistic models, I managed to draw a concrete profile of the victims of the aforementioned crimes, but a question still hung in the air: how to make this analysis a counterfactual capable of transmitting a causal relationship?
 
So I adapted models that made it possible to perform computer experiments through simulations to the empirical results I found in probabilistic models. Thus, I also managed to understand how decisions were taken by people who become criminals and the impact of certain contextual changes in the victimization of robberies against people and homes in Greater Curitiba.
 
These computer simulations make it possible to specify how people interact and also to observe the properties that occur at the level of the entire society without exposing any individual to risk situations. In this way, a base simulation functioned as a counterfactual because it was able to represent an analyzed society without any intervention in the “real world”. That was really good because, in this case, I couldn't just experiment with real people, purposely exposing them to criminality just to test a theory.
 
The final result of the work is its greatest contribution: it allows adaptations that make it possible to simulate public security policies in a virtually controlled environment, which can be very useful to improve the security of society.
